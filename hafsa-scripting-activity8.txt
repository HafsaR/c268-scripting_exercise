Description:
1. Prompts the user for a series of 5-10 integers.
- The user must be prompted for a minimum of 5 numbers.
- After the user has entered 5 numbers, the program should allow the user to stop entry or enter another number.
2. When the user chooses to stop or after 10 numbers have been entered, the program stops prompting for values and performs the following calculations:
- the product of the integers
- the average of the integers
- the sum of the integers
- the min of the integers
- the max of the integers
3. After performing the calculations, the program should display the following to the user:
- the values the user entered
- each of the calculations, using a phrase that identifies the value
