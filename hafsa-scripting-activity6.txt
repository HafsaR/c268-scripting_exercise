Description: 
- Create a script that takes two number parameters a and b and then shows True if a is larger than b or False otherwise.
- Create a second version of the script that then tells the user the difference between the two numbers.
- Remember to code defensively â€“ ensure that your script handles things appropriately if someone enters things incorrectly!
